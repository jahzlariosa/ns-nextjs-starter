# Gemini Standards

This document outlines the standards and practices to be followed by the Gemini AI assistant.

# Feature Implementation Workflow

Before implementing any new feature, a planning document must be created in the `/development` directory (e.g., `/development/feature-name.md`). This document serves as a blueprint for the implementation and should be approved before coding begins.

The planning document should include:
- **Feature Overview**: A brief description of the feature and its purpose.
- **Technical Plan**: Details on the proposed implementation, including:
    - New routes and API endpoints.
    - UI components and dependencies.
    - Database schema changes (if any).
    - Key logic and function signatures.
- **File Structure**: A diagram or list of the new files and directories to be created.
