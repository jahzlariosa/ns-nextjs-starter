# Mermaid Diagrams

This document provides a guide on how to use Mermaid diagrams to create clear and maintainable visualizations.

## What is Mermaid?

Mermaid is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

## How to use Mermaid

To use Mermaid, you need to use the `mermaid` code block in your markdown file. For example, to create a simple flowchart, you would use the following code:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it documented?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Review Documentation];
    B -- No --> D[Document It!];
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E[End];
```

This will render the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it documented?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Review Documentation];
    B -- No --> D[Document It!];
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E[End];
```
